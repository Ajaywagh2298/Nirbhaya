                                    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Building a website is, in many ways, an exercise of willpower. It developed by <b>Saurabh Gangurade & Ajay Wagh .</b>
                                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The idea of developing<b>Nirbhaya (Be Fearless)</b> project in our mind when we go there and how they help. It is a project which is based on pickup and drop facility provide by the police at night time. The idea for this app is triggered due to the Hyderabad incident. As we say the application is totally related to pick up and drop facility provided by police. In these application users may request for the ride from their location to other location. User may take help from the registered volunteers from nearby area. All the facilities like emergency button, complaint box, request box, nearby place map system, volunteer will be managed in the project. all this process is done by the admin and police (Admin / Co-oradinator). if they want use any facility it, they have to do registration and login in system and them use to facilities.
